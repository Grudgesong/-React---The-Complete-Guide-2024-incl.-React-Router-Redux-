// Functional component named Output

export default Output; // Exporting the Output component as the default export

/*
Explanation:

const Output = props => { ... };: This is a functional component declaration using arrow function syntax. It takes props as an argument, which represents the properties passed to the component.
return <p>{props.children}</p>;: This line of code returns JSX to render the content passed as children to the Output component. The props.children property represents the content between the opening and closing tags of the Output component when it's used. In this case, the content is rendered inside a paragraph (<p>) element.
export default Output;: This line exports the Output component as the default export from the module. It allows other files to import and use the Output component by default.
