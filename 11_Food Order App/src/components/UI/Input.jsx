/*
Explanation:

This code defines a functional component named Input, which is exported as the default export of the module.
The component accepts props: label (text for the input label) and id (unique identifier for the input element), as well as any other props (collected using the rest parameter ...props).
Inside the component, a paragraph element with the class control is returned. This class may be used for styling purposes in a CSS framework like Bulma or Bootstrap.
Within the paragraph, a label element is rendered with the text content obtained from the label prop. The htmlFor attribute is set to the value of the id prop, establishing a connection between the label and the input element.
An input element is rendered with the id and name attributes set to the value of the id prop. The required attribute is included by default, indicating that the input is required for form submission.
Any additional props passed to the Input component are spread onto the input element, allowing for further customization such as specifying input type, placeholder text, or event handlers.
This Input component can be used to create form inputs with associated labels, providing accessibility and improved user experience in web forms.
