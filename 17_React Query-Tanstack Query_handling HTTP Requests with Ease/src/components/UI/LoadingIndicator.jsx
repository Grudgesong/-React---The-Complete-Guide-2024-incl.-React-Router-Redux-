/*
This component is a functional component named LoadingIndicator.
It renders a loading spinner using a CSS-based technique called "lds-ring".
The loading spinner consists of four div elements (<div></div>) arranged in a circle.
Each div element represents a part of the loading spinner.
When this component is rendered, it displays a loading animation to indicate that content is being loaded or processed.
This component is typically used to provide visual feedback to users during asynchronous operations such as fetching data or performing long-running tasks.
