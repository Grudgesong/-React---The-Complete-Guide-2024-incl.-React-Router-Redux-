/*
Explanation:

The Card component is a functional component responsible for rendering a card-like container with custom styling.
It imports a CSS module (Card.module.css) which contains styling rules for the card.
Inside the component's JSX, a <section> element is rendered to represent the card container.
The className attribute of the <section> element is set using string interpolation. It combines the classes card from the CSS module (classes.card) with any additional classes passed through the className prop (props.className). This allows for both default styling defined in the CSS module and additional styling provided dynamically through props.
The props.children expression renders any child components passed to the Card component. This allows content to be nested within the card container.
Finally, the Card component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
