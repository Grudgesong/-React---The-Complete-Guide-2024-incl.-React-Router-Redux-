/*
Explanation:

The NewsletterPage component is a React functional component responsible for rendering the newsletter page of the application.
It imports the NewsletterSignup component and the PageContent component. Presumably, the NewsletterSignup component provides a form for users to sign up for the newsletter, and the PageContent component provides a consistent layout for page content with a title.
Inside the component, it renders the PageContent component with specific props:
title="Join our awesome newsletter!": Specifies the title of the newsletter page as "Join our awesome newsletter!". This title will be displayed prominently on the page.
It renders the NewsletterSignup component within the PageContent component, allowing users to sign up for the newsletter.
The component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application where the newsletter page needs to be rendered.
The action function is exported as part of the module. It's typically used as an action handler in routing or form submission contexts.
Inside the action function, it awaits the form data from the request and extracts the email address submitted through the form.
It simulates sending the email address to the backend newsletter server by logging it to the console. This is typically where you would make an API call to the backend server to handle the newsletter signup process.
Finally, it returns a success message as a response object, indicating that the newsletter signup was successful. This response object can be used to provide feedback to the user after submitting the newsletter signup form.
