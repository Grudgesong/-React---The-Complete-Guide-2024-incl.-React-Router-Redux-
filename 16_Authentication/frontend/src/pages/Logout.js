Explanation:

The action function is exported as part of the module. It's typically used as an action handler in routing or authentication-related contexts.
Inside the function, it removes the authentication token and its expiration time from the local storage. This effectively logs out the user by clearing their authentication credentials from the client-side storage.
The localStorage.removeItem method is used to remove the 'token' and 'expiration' items from the local storage, effectively revoking the user's authentication status.
After removing the authentication information, the function uses the redirect function from react-router-dom to redirect the user to the home page (root URL '/'). This ensures that the user is redirected to a specified location after logout, typically back to the application's main page or login page.
By performing these actions, the action function effectively logs out the user from the application and redirects them to an appropriate page, providing a smooth user experience.
