/*
Explanation:

The NewsletterSignup component is a React functional component responsible for rendering a newsletter signup form.
It imports the useFetcher hook from react-router-dom, which is used to manage data fetching.
It also imports CSS styles from an external file (NewsletterSignup.module.css).
Inside the component, it initializes the fetcher object using the useFetcher hook.
It destructures data and state from the fetcher object. data contains the fetched data, and state represents the state of the data fetching process ('idle', 'loading', 'loaded', 'error').
It uses the useEffect hook to execute side effects after rendering. The effect checks if the fetcher state is 'idle' and if there's a message in the data. If both conditions are met, it displays an alert with the message.
The effect is dependent on changes in the data and state variables, ensuring it's re-run when either of them changes.
The component renders a form using fetcher.Form, which is provided by the useFetcher hook. This form is used for submitting newsletter sign-up requests.
Inside the form, there's an input field for entering the email address and a button to submit the form.
The CSS class classes.newsletter is applied to the form, styling it according to the CSS module.
Finally, the NewsletterSignup component is exported as the default export.
